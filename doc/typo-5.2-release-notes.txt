Typo 5.2
========

Welcome to Typo 5.2.  Typo is a blogging platform, like Movable Typo or 
Wordpress, written using Ruby on Rails.

This is the first major release since Typo 5.0.  


Changes since Typo 5.1
----------------------

* Migration to Ruby on Rails 2.2

* A complete admin rewriting, faster, easier to use

* Coderay text filter plugin, for more easy syntax highlighting for code

* Performances improved, Typo is not the bloatware it used to be anymore

* Even better theme support. Up to date themes are at http://typogarden.org

* Cleaner migrations.

* A better search with live search moved as a plugin


How to Install Typo
-------------------

There are two ways to install Typo: automatically, using the new Typo installer, or manually, by downloading the source and building a working Rails environment (database, etc) for it.

New users should use the installer wherever possible because it's substantially easier and less trouble-prone.
